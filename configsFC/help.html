    <h2>Help on Using the Simulator</h2>
    <p>Below are instructions and recommendations for correctly using the 'Fourier Cropper' application.</p>
    <h2><span style='color:#00D000;'>Usage:</span></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The purpose of the simulator is to create a binary mask to serve as a frequency filter for the EntityFrequentialFilter in CUSTOM mode, which can be useful for removing periodic horizontal patterns from an image, for example.
        </li>
        <li>
            The regions drawn on the spectrum magnitude represent the frequencies that will be suppressed later.
        </li>
        <li>
            Currently, the drawing mode is freehand.
        </li>
        <li>
            Press 'R' to clear the drawing.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can execute the flow to load the image connected to the 'inputimage' input of the associated entity or load an arbitrary image from a file using the 'Load image' button.
        </li>
        <li>
            When saving the filter mask, you can either write the extension or just the name; in the latter case, it will be saved in PNG format.
        </li>
        <li>
            If 'Crop Mode' is ON, then you draw those spectrum part which will be supressed when filtering.
            If 'Crop Mode' is OFF, then you draw those spectrum parts which will be the only leftover when filtering.
        </li>
        <li>
            The mask is saved in 8-bit 0-255 format.
        </li>
    </ul>
